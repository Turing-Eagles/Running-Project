Comments from Qi:
1. put those documents for Inception Phase under the directory of /deliverables/inception/
2. missing at least one meeting minute
3. Next time you can put the use case diagram in the use case documents. 
   Again what are alpha/delta users? If they are not common concepts, please define a dictionary to describe them.
4. Missing the Vision Document.

2/19:
1. What are alpha/delta/omega users? Please make them consistent.
2. The summary of use case diagrams should be included in the Vision Document.
